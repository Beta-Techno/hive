Here's how it works:\n\n✨ How you earn points:\nEvery message you send = +1 point\nEvery reaction you receive = +2 points\nEvery day you're active = +3 points\n\nYour total score decides your Hive role 🐝\n\n🎖 Roles:\nBuzzer (30–99 pts) → New but buzzing with activity\nHoney Maker (100–199 pts) → Sweet contributors who keep things flowing\nWorker Bee (200–299 pts) → Core members who keep the Hive strong\nFounding Bee (300+ pts) → OGs and pillars of the Hive\nQueen's Guard → Special trusted testers (invite-only)\n\nNo shortcuts: spam doesn't count — it's about being active, consistent, and adding real value to the hive.\n\nSo keep buzzing, keep sharing, and keep the Hive alive 💛\n\n— @ALiCE  🐝",
