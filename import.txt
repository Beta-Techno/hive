[11:01 PM]nickbg: I used bitbucket untill two years ago
[11:01 PM]tombombadeel: Yeah I’m a total amateur with code, only been learning python just recently. Haven’t used the API much at all before

And yes, also going to bed shortly because I actually sleep
[11:01 PM]nickbg: whenever you want to start. feel free to ask every and every question here
[11:01 PM] 
OP
 Sato: One thing that is funny you see how simple it is 😅
[11:01 PM]nickbg: I am no where near satos level, I should be able to help with the easy stuff
[11:02 PM]nickbg: especially when you let the model do the work
[11:02 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Hopefully what I've shown provides more reason why I say people use llms wrong and add too many things or over complicate things
[11:02 PM]Scott: Yeah it's more the guardrails I think that will be more complicated
[11:03 PM]nickbg: impossible
[11:03 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Haha will get onto that later
[11:03 PM] 
OP
 Sato: My jobs to make guardrails so yeah 😅
[11:04 PM]tombombadeel: I appreciate it! As long as I don’t empty my bank account into a gnarly API call I’m happy to keep it moving to learn lol
[11:04 PM]Scott: just set limits
[11:04 PM]tombombadeel: no
[11:05 PM] 
OP
 Sato: I might be able to set up so it tells you tokens for completion and get your balance
[11:05 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Unsure if able to via api yet not sure public has that version
[11:06 PM] 
OP
 Sato: The lib I have for example for openai let's me pull my chats from chatgpt too 😅 which should be public soon
[11:07 PM]Scott: Ah good, I've regularly exported mine but it would be good to have access
[11:08 PM] 
OP
 Sato: That's something you could do is ask the one I've shared to organise them for you into a chat history folder by chat id then when I add ui via git you can view those chats haha
[11:08 PM]tombombadeel: Realistically there’s very little chance I use even the $20 that Plus costs when testing things out. I’m not actually worried
[11:10 PM] 
OP
 Sato: When it's set to high it'll use 20 in minutes 😆 especially if it's high on all agents and based on how many
[11:11 PM]Scott: Even on nano?
[11:11 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Nooo I mean gpt 5 on high everything
[11:11 PM]Scott: ahh
[11:12 PM]Scott: oh yeah you said that
[11:12 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Need to add threading before doing that though and background sync
[11:13 PM] 
OP
 Sato: When that's added you can then talk with it while it waits for a response from an agent lol 😆
[11:13 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Like an octopus
[11:14 PM]tombombadeel: I simply will not be doing that then 😫 ya boy trying to b u y a house not invoke the AI’s wrath
[11:14 PM]tombombadeel: That’s wild. More of a present model then than the sort of stasis that models generally operate in
[11:16 PM] 
OP
 Sato: 🤣 I mean there is different options really. Open source it, or each of you that contribute and build the whole system tools and integrate it into what I share, you could a business from it, and use it or try pitch to investors showing the system but then can't open source it mhmm I don't want anything from this but that it's used for good things...
[11:17 PM]nickbg: I will replace my basic mcp that I use with my company with this immediately
[11:18 PM]nickbg: My gratitude is immense
[11:20 PM] 
OP
 Sato: The one thing I say though is no one shares it until we all agree its ready ... and it's fine one idea could be open source it still once its at v1 state and then if you decide to build something from it you could 🤔 we will see because I'm only giving one strike... and that persons out and anything contributed will be pulled and sent to them but not included within the final version. I should make a doc 🤔 we will see... 
[11:23 PM]nickbg: @Sato I am not smart. My name is does not make an attempt to hide my personal info. If we are contributing to open source together can we dox ourselves or will that break the one strike?
[11:24 PM]nickbg: I never kept op-sec before. I would have to join as a new account to be completely anon
[11:24 PM]tombombadeel: I’ll do my best to contribute at least from a conceptual point of view, considering I’m not a programmer. But I absolutely will help any way I can cus you know I love theory crafting
[11:24 PM]tombombadeel: “I am not smart” 😂
[11:25 PM]nickbg: my goal was to give Alice access to all my companies which would reveal my id
you wanted people to join the hive. If we had a bunch of normal people join under their real name, would that be bad? 
[11:25 PM] 
OP
 Sato: @Karl can you run locally?
[11:26 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Just don't let anyone know about it maybe make a new git with a protonmail account just for this?
[11:26 PM]Karl: I’ve ‘borrowed’ my work laptop for the weekend. It’s shite but better than nothing. I plan to try this over the weekend. It’s a new frontier for me, but I’m excited to try 
[11:27 PM]Scott: My proto email might be too obvious for who I am, maybe I'll use something completely random then
[11:27 PM]nickbg: I just set up a new git with a new email account for this exactly
[11:27 PM]nickbg: I am talking about this discord account: nickbg
[11:28 PM]nickbg: my name is nick, this account is used across companies that are public. I am forcing 50+ people to use discord every day during there jobs for this HIVE expeirement
[11:28 PM] 
OP
 Sato: Okay mhm I can host it with a UI ok a server but yeah by then I'll have the git ready to clone it and just run the main file and visit the local host it provides
[11:32 PM]tombombadeel: If you go into the ProtonPass thing you can create an Alias that forwards to your primary protonmail account
[11:35 PM]Karl: Create an alias for your proton mail, though that might be a paid feature
[11:35 PM]Scott: It does say this Proton Pass with 10 hide-my-email aliases, although can't find where you do it
[11:36 PM]Karl: Proton Pass is a separate app you login to with your proton account. It’s basically a password manager with fancy features
[11:36 PM]Scott: Fuck it I'll just create a new one as I only just created this anyway
[11:40 PM]Karl: I’m not even sure yet how to run this locally on my work laptop. I’m sure it’s not hard to find out. It will do the heavy work in the API right, so the laptop nit having much juice shouldn’t be an issue? I’m capable of figuring this out, but thought I’d ask anyway. I learn about all this stuff everyday. But haven’t put any of it into practice. My work laptop is locked down to me (not that work knows this lol, again we have zero IT management, so I’ve locked them out of it), so it’s safe in that sense.
[11:40 PM]Karl: Boomer
[11:41 PM]nickbg: If you can't run it on your laptop. I paid for a replit account earlier this month for regollos to try cause he couldnt run it on his computer. I can share the replit account with you @Karl if you can't get it on your computer and then as long as you can access a web browser you can run it
[11:41 PM]nickbg: you can even run it on your iphone with replit
[11:42 PM]Karl: Honestly my only limitations here are poverty and hardware. Not playing tiny violins, just being honest about my circumstances. 
[11:42 PM]Scott: You can possibly use GitHub Codespaces
[11:42 PM]nickbg: I have a replit account I can share with you, the problem is I have to dox myself to share these. They are accounts I pay through my company that have official info on them
[11:43 PM]nickbg: I can dm you, I just am scared of @Sato with the one strike policy. I am an adult but as he observed I have the mental capacity of a child in some aspects
[11:43 PM]Karl: Y’all can save me finding out I guess. What app or interface do I need to download that can run this to interact with API?
[11:44 PM]nickbg: if you are doing it locally I would recommend cursor is easy to start. What would you say @Scott
[11:45 PM]Karl: I don’t expect you to share things like that @nickbg if I can figure it out myself. I can either find out what to do myself, or just have one of you tell me.
[11:45 PM]Scott: I use VS Code with GitHub Copilot, perhaps Cursor might be easier for non-devs, although it's basically the same I think?
[11:45 PM]Scott: Chatterroo can tell you
[11:46 PM]Karl: Yeah I can use my own ChatGPT to explain it.
[11:50 PM]nickbg: yeah I think github copilot has caught up by now. Back a year and two ago cursor was ahead
[11:50 PM]Karl: I think Groq is another option. There’s another popular one I can’t think of but it might be just for running models locally
[11:51 PM]Scott: Yeah you can choose to use different models with it
[11:52 PM]Scott: Seems to work well
[11:52 PM]Scott: Cursor is basically built on top of VS Code
[11:54 PM]nickbg: its a fork
[12:02 AM]Scott: It's forked
[12:02 AM]nickbg: Have you made any progress? @Scott
[12:03 AM]nickbg: with the self modification
[12:06 AM]Scott: Nah not now, I'll wait until Sato has set up the git
[12:07 AM]nickbg: I thought we were going to try to figure it out without him? haha
[12:07 AM]nickbg: I wanted to give up when he told karl he was going to go ahead and build and share everything anyways
[12:08 AM]Scott: No point doing duplicate work. It runs as it, but I'll wait for the git
[12:08 AM]nickbg: I kinda want to understand it to trust it, need to to run it on business stuff
if I share my progress with you would you mind helping still?
[12:10 AM]Scott: What specifically are you trying to do?
[12:11 AM]nickbg: this
[12:12 AM]Scott: I've added the code i.e. def run_python(code: str) -> str: etc but haven't tried it on a specific task
[12:13 AM]nickbg: That is just having it run python, I set that up write away

i am tyring to get it to be able to build the run_python() module itself on the fly
so you you start with a bare agent and say
"build yourself a tool to execute python in a sandbox"
and then it can make itself the tool without you
[12:14 AM]nickbg: I love my typos when I type fast. I have to spellcheck and re read going foward to avoid constant edits
[12:14 AM]Scott: I was going to wait for the git repository before spending too long on it
[12:15 AM]nickbg: I don't blame you
this is a very fun challenge. I have always wanted to build this but have never trusted myself on the safety / containment end 
[12:20 AM]nickbg: this is honestly so fun talking to the program I am building about itself 
i have never spent api tokens for building instead use cursor / codex/ gpt-pro $200 subscription

you get a taste of this building any software with ai but the direct recursiveness of this is maddening. going between the cli and the composer agent as a pure spectator
you almost wish it was not this easy
[12:21 AM]Scott: Yeah, I don't have a specific use case to test with, sounds like you do though?
[12:24 AM]nickbg: So right now I just use the basic mcp router with the ai orgs apis. So to do anything you have to continuously prompt the agent. I have autonomous workflows that can be set up and run on demand or schedule but its all very static unless I go in and modify the git. I don't let agents talk to one another or self modify in any way. 

we humans use the models. we recognize the repetitive tasks and create our workflows as needed. This as I understand closes the circle and the model can remember and create its own workflows
[12:25 AM]Scott: i probably wouldn't try to use this for a real world business situation initially, other than just to test
[12:25 AM]nickbg: Why not on read only data?
[12:26 AM]Scott: Well depends what you're going to do with it
[12:27 AM]nickbg: we have digital records going back 7 years
quickbooks exported into db with api
our projects estimates and tracking are all available via api / by extension mcp
everything else in drive / gmail / gcalendar can be given read only through a account that has limited scope
[12:27 AM]nickbg: instead of letting a single agent work on any one of the things we ask to do, I can ask a HiVE
[12:28 AM]nickbg: pull this data from quickbooks and compare costs to the estimate. where are profit and loss
[12:28 AM]nickbg: Most of this can be done with the single agent, we aren't doing anything crazy at the companies I am in
[12:28 AM]nickbg: but the idea that that agent can self modify. That completely takes me out of the loop and makes me redundant as a dev
[12:31 AM]nickbg: am I crazy? anywhere in my local town I would be looked at like a freak for saying these things out loud. Please be blunt and honest with me
[12:33 AM]Scott: You may well be crazy, I can't deny that 😂  Although you won't be redundant if you keep improving systems.
[12:34 AM]nickbg: I don't think I get any credit for the system improving itself
[12:35 AM]Scott: Well, I suspect it'll need a lot of testing and validation before its production ready
[12:35 AM]nickbg: Are you using these models in your workflows at all?
[12:35 AM]Scott: Not without a human in the loop
[12:36 AM]nickbg: With this you can pause between requests to itself and stay in the loop just the same, no?
[12:36 AM]Scott: yeah, although without a useer interface it's very hard to properly understand what's going on
[12:37 AM]nickbg: of course, impossible
[12:39 AM]nickbg: are there 0 workflows that you trust to be unsupervised at the moment?
[12:39 AM]Scott: yes, unless you're into spam
[12:40 AM]nickbg: I don't understand
[12:41 AM]nickbg: I don't like spam in my email, using gpt to auto sort inbox and give it permission to move a certain limited scope of emails into inboxes without supervision so you get less spam
[12:42 AM]nickbg: it exposes you to prompt injection, a vulnerability I kind of just accept at the moment as each agents scope is limited to only what it needs for that given workflow (move email tool only, not send or delete)
[12:42 AM]Scott: I don't generally have an unmanageable amount of email at present to need AI
[12:43 AM]nickbg: I don't either. Well to be honest my inbox is like 30,000+ from ten years of a lot of stuff. 
but all the people that run local business that I help. especially the computer illiterate that are rather slow behind a desk
[12:43 AM]nickbg: would you trust stuff like this unsupervised?
[12:44 AM]nickbg: I have few to talk to to check reality with, that what I am doing is not wrong / accepted in industry
[12:44 AM]Scott: probably not, depends on the task though... if it "helped" rather than actually did the work, then potentially
[12:51 AM]Scott: Also for workflow stuff you need to ensure you have "b u y in" from the right people or they won't want it
[12:53 AM]nickbg: you said I am crazy. Can I talk to you about this but you have to promise to check me where you disagree with me?
[12:53 AM]nickbg: this is my biggest challenge more so than building the tooling 
[12:53 AM]nickbg: societies acceptance of it
[12:54 AM]nickbg: I don't have any good answers
[12:54 AM]Scott: Lol that was just a joke about being crazy
[12:56 AM]nickbg: what is your opinion on getting peoples acceptance / participation
[12:57 AM]nickbg: for people that refuse to use this / what is the proper approach with a company?
[12:57 AM]nickbg: how does a owner of a company navigate the ethics of transitioning to a post human economy?
[12:57 AM]Scott: That is always the struggle when it comes to any IT implementation
[12:57 AM]nickbg: But this isn't IT
[12:58 AM]nickbg: in the office for our secretary, 90% of her job is ocr and document management
[12:58 AM]nickbg: this is all mcp now
[12:58 AM]Scott: It won't replace everyone's jobs... these things will take a while to implement
[12:59 AM]nickbg: not everyones, no. and new jobs yeah... I know the shpiel
[1:00 AM]nickbg: but right now, our secretary is very much a redundancy: we can just have the foreman / owner validate the ocr as they already do
[1:03 AM]nickbg: my earlier question that I didnt send becuase I dont know when I am pressing too much

at what rate do you allow it to run autonomous. If you test every morning and validate after:

99% ( 1 in 100 error rate )
99.9999% ( 1 in 1,000,000 )

is it spam to not pay someone to man the office / phones if you can automate it? I get it is not ideal for those that want to speak to humans. But the big corporations are doing it. I don't know if the small orgs will survive if they don't adapt to the cheap slop, even if it is a worse ux
[1:06 AM]Karl: I'm busy right now, but just politely chiming here. Don't take this as criticism. It's a good conversation. Just saying it's getting a little off topic for this thread. Let's keep this focused to bulding etc. Just forward this other stuff to another channel, like Meeting or Break room.
[1:07 AM]nickbg: Sorry and thank you

1:08 AM]Karl: No need to apologise Nick. Just sayin it cos it makes it harder for others to catch up on the details when trying to follow the build etc, if they have to scroll past a lot of side chat. No problem at all with the conversation.

[2:22 AM] 
OP
 Sato: wtf lol
[2:33 AM]CrystalKnight💎
: Bad choice of words 🤣. Claude sign up is cooked no idea what they did but it did not allow us to choose a different email. It took that info from browser and wouldn't let us change it. So none of us got in under our company accounts 😆. And I can't use Claude code on my own account because it only   recognises Claude.ai and not my desktop app. Can't be bothered to figure what the hell they did. It already took me 2 weeks to fix all the initial mcps they released back in the day.
[2:39 AM]

 Sato: rip anthropic lol
[2:42 AM]CrystalKnight💎
: My passwords are so secure I never remember them. 🤣
[2:47 AM]Scott: Yeah that's what I hate about services that I only have the keys to 😂
[2:52 AM]nickbg: @Sato 

if your still awake
did you choose python to make it simple for us or is that your personal preference when building these systems? 
[3:01 AM] 
OP
 Sato: Easier for people to use and learn from as it's an easy language to understand. I could share the C version if you want but I got a feeling it would confuse you lmao
[3:01 AM]nickbg: It would
[3:01 AM]nickbg: I had played around with this before in JS, which I am more native with
[3:03 AM]Scott: Python's not my number one language but it seems for this kind of thing the simplest and it's easy to get up and run scripts. I hate how it's a cunt about tabs though
[3:03 AM]nickbg: yeah, I find myself motherfucking python alot right now just out of pure unfamiliarity
[3:03 AM] 
OP
 Sato: Back in the day before IDE told you the error C was fun trying to find the missing semicolon...
[3:05 AM] 
OP
 Sato: See python is ideal, most libs access your system, you can host a backend route api endpoint using flask or fastAPI, and then just build a UI front end, that interacts with the routes and let the flask/fastapi handle tools and requests while the front end just renders it all.
[3:05 AM]nickbg: not to interrupt old memories but sato this is so cool to see. I am also just on the bridge of 24 hours straight but my adreniline is keeping me awake more than I have been in a while

[3:05 AM]Scott: Yeah, I used to use C# quite a bit which was very strict about that and everything, where as JavaScript is like "Yeah whatever, if you want semicolons I don't care". I prefer strongly typed languages though, I definitely prefer Typescript over pure JavaScript
[3:05 AM]nickbg: yeah python is also better for the agents to write. The cheap agents dont handle C well from my knowledge
[3:06 AM]nickbg: but I think I got the cli to build its own tooling on the fly
[3:06 AM]nickbg: to have the cli debug itself in real time is WILD 
[3:06 AM]nickbg: feel the agi for the first time I guess
[3:06 AM]nickbg: thank you
[3:06 AM]Scott: AIs tend to default to python when you don't specify a programming language - I guess that's part of the fine tuning process
[3:07 AM] 
OP
 Sato: Yeah manly because it's a plug in and play sort of coding language
[3:08 AM] 
OP
 Sato: Writing pure JS is like standing on lego at 3am
[3:08 AM]Scott: Yeah seems a bit less chaotic than setting up a node.js project. Usually the issue I have setting up a Python project is realising I don't need so much other shit just to get it running
[3:09 AM]

 Sato: literally install python, then install pip and then run code haha
[3:09 AM] 
OP
 Sato: obvs requirements first before running lol
[3:13 AM]Karl: Tbh it surprises me that so much code isn't perfect lol. Like I can't do this off the top of my head anymore. But up until 20 years ago I could, in HTML CSS JS Py and Perl. And I was a total perfectionist because I hated debugging my own code. I really need to refresh myself, it shocking how much I've forgotten, to the point I can vaguely comprehend it but can't write it anymore.

[3:15 AM] 
OP
 Sato: 'what does this do?' 

me:
It just works.
[3:15 AM]Karl: Comments were always annoying, but I became a stickler for that too, so I'd rember what shit did if I DID have to debug something
[3:16 AM] 
OP
 Sato: I prefer to just make a doc file explaining everything and how it links together and usage way easier comments do get out of control
[3:17 AM]Karl: I'm sure I can get up to speed again if I try, this is the first thing that's given me a reason to do so
[3:20 AM]Scott: AIs quite good for writing comments but then it over explains stuff
[3:21 AM]Scott: Good function and variable names and the odd comment should make most things easy to read
[3:21 AM]Scott: That said, I initially wasn't sure what the API key environment variable was supposed to be, but that was my fault for not reading like the 4th line of code 😂
[3:21 AM]Karl: Yeah, back in my day (lol), commenting wasn't verbose, because storage and bandwidth were very limited

: I can't do ID Verification because I don't have a card ID only the book 🤣 . Probably better though
[5:04 AM]Scott: Book?
[5:05 AM]nickbg: passport book I presume
[5:05 AM]Scott: I ended up using my passport which was hard to get fully in the frame with all the details but it worked in the end
[5:07 AM]CrystalKnight💎
: No we have actual ID books. Green Barcoded book. Even my Passport is a book. Not that I know where that is. LOL
[5:08 AM]Scott: Our passports are a book, you just need the one page
[5:10 AM]Scott: Mine was expired too, worked fine
[5:11 AM]CrystalKnight💎
: It didn't take it ..  possibly because I was lazy and put in image which is sideways. LOL. Ugghh off to find the actual book
[5:12 AM]Scott: I had trouble trying to hold it flat without covering the numbers!
[5:13 AM]Scott: I should have tried generating one with ChatGPT and seen if it worked
[5:19 AM]CrystalKnight💎
: Considered it for a second. LOL. Might not read mine my voting stamp bled through the page. Will just use passport if properly oriented book doesn't work. This would have failed my QA tests 😆
[5:19 AM]Scott: I don't think it needs to be perfect, my passport number was not fully in frame
[5:22 AM]Scott: Try this one

[5:37 AM]Karl: If you told it that it just made it. It would gaslight you again too
[5:38 AM]Karl: But let's keep this thread on topic anyway
[5:48 AM]Scott: I will have a look at this soon, commenting on it to bring it back to the conversation. I'm wondering too if when working out any libraries to either install or are available it needs to have access to an index so it doesn't just make shit up, as well as the latest documentation. Same for any APIs
